I made a new F-Tool because i got sick of the current one. Its not completely done yet but the core features are working pretty well already.
So now im looking for testers that can give me feedback on what could be improved or what bugs there are.

Things that this tool does differently from the current one:
- is only a tool for spamming (the other one has things like collector and buffer and stuff. idk if any1 even uses those, i certainly never did)
- Setting of a F-Bar is not required so it wont spam your chat while using it (although it can if you want it to)
- Hotkeys for enabling and disabling a spammer (Shift + F1 for the first spammer... etc.)
- delay is set in milliseconds instead of full seconds.

Things that will maybe be coming one day (or not):
- setting custom hotkeys
